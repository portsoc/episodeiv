Star Wars in CSS
===

The scrolling text from Star Wars is defined in `index.txt`.  This is marked up in `index.html`.  To see the development of a style sheet, edit the stylesheet definition changing the style from `style0` through to `style7`.

e.g.
```html
<link href="style/style0.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
becomes
```html
<link href="style/style1.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
Add a starfield with
```html
<script src="stars.js"></script>
```
